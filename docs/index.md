# What is Cillow?

Cillow is an open-source library that enables you to execute AI-generated code in a controlled environment. The name "Cillow" follows the same naming convention as "Pillow" (Python Imaging Library), representing its role as a Code Interpreter Library.

It offers key features such as:

- **Environment Switching**: Effortlessly switch between multiple Python environments.
- **Automated Package Installation**: Automatically install imported packages using `uv` or `pip`.
- **Functionality Patches**: Apply patches to restrict the scope of AI-generated code, capture outputs such as `stdout`, `stderr`, images, plots, and more.
