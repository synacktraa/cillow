# What is Cillow?

Cillow is an open-source library that enables you to execute AI-generated code in a controlled environment. The name "Cillow" follows the same naming convention as "Pillow" (Python Imaging Library), representing its role as a Code Interpreter Library.

It offers key features such as:

- **Environment Switching**: Easily switch between multiple python environments.
- **Automated Package Management**: Automatic installation of imported packages through `uv` or `pip`.
- **Functionality Patches**: Apply patches to limit the scope of AI-generated code, capture outputs like `stdout`, `stderr`, images, plots, etc., and more.
