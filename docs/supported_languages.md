At the moment, Cillow only supports Python, as it does not rely on Jupyter Kernel/Lab.

This project began as an exploration of [E2B](https://e2b.dev/)'s code interpreter. I implemented the Python interpreter from scratch, taking a different approach by adding features like environment switching and functionality patching. Recognizing the potential of the project, I expanded it into a client-server architecture using ZeroMQ, threading, and multiprocessing.
