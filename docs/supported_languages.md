At the moment, Cillow only supports Python since it doesn't use Jupyter Kernel.

This project began as an exploration of [E2B](https://e2b.dev/)'s code interpreter. I implemented the Python interpreter from scratch using ZeroMQ, taking a different approach by adding features like environment switching and functionality patching. Seeing the potential in this project, I evolved it into a client-server architecture using threading and multiprocessing.
